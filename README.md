Starting my application

Clone the repository
If the user doesn't have the code on their local machine, they'll need to clone it from the repository.

Navigate to the project directory
Once the repository is cloned, the user will need to navigate to the project directory

Install Docker
Your application is containerized using Docker, so the user will need to have Docker installed on their machine.

Build the Docker image
Next, the user will need to build the Docker image for your application. Provide the command to do this: docker build -t my-app-dev -f Dockerfile.dev .

Run the Docker container

After the image is built, the user can run a Docker container from it: docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name my-app-dev-containerdev-app
Access the application

create docker image and container for nginx

docker build -f Dockerfile.nginx -t nginx-image . //docker image
docker run -d --name my-nginx-container -p 80:80 nginx-image //docker container

\\\\\\\\\\TO START ALL CONTAINERS ///////////
docker-compose-up --build

Finally, tell the user how to access the running application. If it's a web application, it's likely accessible at http://localhost:3000.
